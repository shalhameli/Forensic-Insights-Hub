# Forensic Insights Hub – Digital Forensics Toolkit

Forensic Insights Hub is a Python-based digital forensics toolkit designed to support **Windows Registry analysis** through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). The tool assists forensic investigators in collecting, analyzing, and reporting key system artifacts such as installed software, hardware details, user accounts, registry modification timelines, and registry exports.

The project focuses on simplifying complex forensic tasks by automating registry analysis using Python, making it accessible to both experienced investigators and beginners while maintaining forensic integrity.
